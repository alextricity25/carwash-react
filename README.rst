I like to wash cars.

This is the repository for the front end of the carwash website - a tool designed
to help detailers and car washing enthusiasts. Think of a place where you can
manage all your tools, towels, washes, and details. Relationships between tools
and washes can be customized to present you with a simple list of what tools you
will need for each wash or detail. Product information will be rich and detailed
for each tool, towel, and cleaner.

Estimated time for a wash or detail? We have you covered. Carwash will use previous
wash times to estimate total time for a wash or detail to be completed.

Carwash will allow you to create step-by-step wash or detail plans that can be
played back for a full walk through of what needs to be done. Each step will include
the tool that needs to be used, detailed instructions, and any products that will
need to be used

Clean the cleaners? Yes! This needs to be done. How to clean brushes, pads, and other
equipment can be included on each wash, or it can be added as a seperate plan on its
own.
